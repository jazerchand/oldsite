                <p>With help from my mentor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saumyakharbanda">Saumya Kharbanda</a>, I was able to set first-time voters as the target group and identify a broad framework for an inquiry into the Indian political sphere.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="project_inforow-right"> 
                <p>The next step was to create a road-map for interviewing urban <span>first-time voters</span>. All questions were inclined towards finding their <span>political interest against political awareness.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p>Here are some of the leading insights - </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><span>A sense of responsibility piques political interest.</span></p></li>

                    <li><p><span>Feels political awareness is time-consuming.</span></p></li>

            <div class="project_inforow-right">
                <p>These insights informed the next step of defining specific objectives and goals. Next, I gathered my peers (also first-time voters) to help me prioritize them by voting.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After prioritizing, I brainstormed and generated 3-4 solutions for each of the objectives.<span>The idea here was to generate first, and critique later.</span></p>
