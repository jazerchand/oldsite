                <p>This project unfolded as a part of my third year's UX module. After brainstorming a few ideas for a new mobile application, one finally stood out to us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We visualized an app that allows readers to highlight and share those certain lines that they find truly valuable while reading an article online.</p>

            <div class="project_inforow-right">
                <p>The next step forward was to iteratively define our vision and mission statement. <span>Our goal was to articulate something that was just as open-ended as it was defined.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p>To achieve this, we worked our way up the <a href="youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4?t=142" target="_blank">Golden Circle.</a></p>

                <p>To create a thoughtful experience, we had to first identify our users. We crafted a fairly open-ended survey and deployed it on social groups.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here are some of the questions that we asked - </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><span>What kind of environment do you usually read in?</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Why does the above-selected environment work<br> out for you?</span></p></li>

                <p>We identified two most common user profiles: The Screen Reader and The Paper Reader.</p>

            <div class="project_inforow-right">
                <p>The insights that we got from our scenarios helped us to strategize further. We translated them to almost every next-step of the process.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span>UX Strategy</span></p>
                <p>It was clear to us that the platform should be "content-first" and "social-second".<span> We had to prioritize content over responses, highlights over names, and curation over feed.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p><span>UI Strategy</span></p>
                <p>Our primary users prefer a certain environment for reading. The interface had to resonate that <span>calm, comforting and non-disruptive environment.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p><span>Brand Strategy</span></p>
                <p>The brand had to align itself in a way that would encourage meaningful highlight sharing. So it was <span>mindful</span> at its core, <span>expressive</span> on the inside, and <span>inviting</span> on the outside.</p>

                <p>To create the userflows, we focused on our UX strategy. Fetching valuable highlights for the reader came first, whereas navigation to their public profile came last.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span>Task 1 - To share a highlight</span></p>
                <p>The userflow will typically initiate when the user makes a text selection on their browser, hits 'share', and then selects 'Spotlight' from the app drawer.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span>Task 2- To discover a highlight</span></p>
                <p>The userflow will initiate at the 'Home' Screen which curates highlights based on the user's interests, followings, and recent engagements.</p>

                <p>Next step was to wireframe almost 15-16 screens. We went with a good old pencil and paper for this one.</p>
